# 💰 Budget Forecaster

A professional personal financial planning and cash flow forecasting tool
built with Python — modelled after the type of financial dashboards used by
FP&A teams. Powered by Streamlit, Plotly, Statsmodels, and Scikit-learn.

## 📤 Uploading Your Own Data

Export a CSV from your bank with these columns:

| Column | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Date | ✅ | Any common format (MM/DD/YY, YYYY-MM-DD, …) |
| Merchant | ✅ | Payee / description |
| Amount | ✅ | Negative = expense, positive = income |
| Account | ☐ | Defaults to "Checking" |
| Type | ☐ | Auto-derived from Amount sign |

---

## 🔭 Forecasting Models

| Model | Best for | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Exponential Smoothing** | Most data (default) | Holt-Winters, handles trend |
| **ARIMA** | Autocorrelated series | Auto-selects fallback order |
| **Linear Regression** | Clear trends | Simple, interpretable |
| **Moving Average** | Stable spending | Naïve baseline |

---

## 🎲 Monte Carlo Simulation

Runs N simulations (default 10,000) drawing monthly income and expenses
from normal distributions and adding random surprise expenses.

Outputs:
- Probability balance stays positive
- Probability balance falls below emergency threshold
- Probability savings goal is achieved
- P10 / P50 / P90 final balance percentiles
- Fan chart of simulation paths

## 🩺 Financial Health Score

| Component | Weight | Target |
|---|---|---|
| Savings Rate | 30 pts | ≥ 20% |
| Emergency Fund | 25 pts | ≥ 6 months |
| Expense Consistency | 20 pts | Low month-to-month variance |
| Cash Flow Positivity | 25 pts | Income > expenses every month |

Grades: **Excellent** (90–100) · **Good** (75–89) · **Fair** (60–74) · **Needs Improvement** (< 60)
